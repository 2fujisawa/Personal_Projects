There are 4 fundamental concepts when it comes to programming code that is Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

- Example OOP languages: Python, C++, Ruby, Java, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go

Object: Anything you want to store and process data about, anyting from the real world
Entity: 

1. Abstraction : Simplifiying reality, relevant data you want to use in your program.
To create a object you need to first create a class(template of a object) which contains 
    - Attributes/Properties and Operations/Methods

Creating an object from a class is called instantiation and each object of the same class type can be created as a unique entity

(Its also possible to assign values to properties while the object is being instantiated by using the new keyword) This method is called the constructor variable = new class("Assigned values)")

 
2. Encapsulation : Hiding Data and Complexity(Information Hiding)
Data and Operations are safe when moving

3. Inheritance: A class can derive(obtain) its methods and properties from another class and extend it
Ex. (Base Class)/(Superclass) Person - Properties(name, age, gender, fast) <- (subclass)Employee - Properties(Person, position) <- (subclass)Programmer(Employee, programming language)


4. Polymorphism:  A class can implement an inhertited method in its own way

When creating a base class or superclass you create a specifc method that is copied into the subclasses, however there are times you would want to change the method for certain 
subclasses, Polymorphism is basically the term described to adjust the method that was copied from the superclass
